The keybord plugin let you control voluem and playback using a keyboard. While this might not sound too interesting, 
there are many devices that act like a keyboard, e.g. a lot of RF remote controls.
These usually come with a USB dongle that identifies itself as a USB keyboard. A press on the remote control will be
mapped to a specific key.

```
[keyboard]
# Map commands to specific scancodes
volume_up=115
volume_down=114
next=106
previous=105
playpause=28
```
